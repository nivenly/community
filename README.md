# Nivenly Community 

This repository is for the purpose of Nivenly Community Discussions that need to happen
in a public sphere, rather than being limited to the Nivenly Community Discord or other
siloed resources.

All discussions that happen in Nivenly spaces must be collaborative in nature and
are bound by the [Nivenly Covenant](https://nivenly.org/covenant/). What this means:

1. Please bring comments and concerns!
2. Treat each other and moderators, with respect.

It is likely that public Nivenly Community Discussions will not be hosted by GitHub
indefinitely, but rather we are leveraging GitHub in the interim to faciliate member
conversations.

As a reminder:

1. Any Nivenly member can request discussions or election processes
2. Any Nivenly member can vot in elections
3. In our first year, we've communicated that we're iterating on feedback loops as
   we try to make tooling choices that are intuitive and don't require several,
   separate, logins.
4. Create and support change via sustainable paths to conflict resolution.

One of the requests we've made of all members, regardless of member class, is to
work with us while we set up and test to see what works and should be kept, and what
doesn't and should be iterated on or removed entirely. As a result, we thank everyone
for their patience while we spin up and improve on feedback loops and governance
cycles.

## How do I engage in Nivenly's governance process as a Community Member?

If you are a member, and mebers are tracked via our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/nivenly-foundation),
then you can open a request with Nivenly either via the Community Discord,
here on GitHub Issuess, or even via email. Mainly, you just need to start a
request in any avenue you choose, e.g.:

> Hey! I have a [problem|question|concern] about a decision making process
> and would like to [offer feedback|request change|have a community vote] about
> [whatever the process, issue, or decision is].

Please note that only engaging in governance process (even if you need to ask
how) will trigger changes. 

### Quick FAQ

#### I want to request change, or inform Nivenly of information that might change a decision, but I don't know how. Help?

First things first: just ask! Since we're still in our first year, and our members
of all chambers are building the Foundation with us, one expectation that we've set
is that we'll roll out interim (and binding) processes as we making tooling decisions
to help simplify the discussion + election process.

#### What is the current change / voice process?

Discussions are happening in GitHub Issues. 

#### I want to have a discussion, but Nivenly didn't make a GitHub Issue. What do I do?

Nivenly Community Mmebers are active parts of governance. Nivenly doesn't create
Community Issues on behalf of the Community in general, rather the interested
parties post their questions and topics.

If you are a Nivenly Community Member with a question or concern, please simply
raise it. You do not need to wait for approval from Nivenly to request a discussion
or the governance process.

#### Is Nivenly's governance model ready?

Yes! It's the actual tooling / implementation that we're iterating on. The model
itself is ready.
